# hiraeth
Hiraethe is a web-based application (game-based model) which helps evaluate a person's depression, anxiety and stress by having them answer a questionnaire.
Hiraeth follows a simplistic and engaging layout with a very user friendly interface.

It has a fully functioning signup and login set up including a feedback section where user's can drop their opinions and views about Hiraeth so we can continue to make Hiraeth better for them.
This was a Group based research project under the supervision of Incognito Blueprints Research Bootcamp.
